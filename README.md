nf_population_genetics
==

## Summary
Part of the nuclear horizontal transfer in CTVT project. This repository
contains the nextflow pipeline used to produce all the population genetics
results in the paper.

The `nextflow.config` is set up to run on the compute farm at the Sanger. Running on any
other platforms will need some modifications.

## Dependencies
All dependencies are provided through the container [TODO...] (Nextflow itself will need to be installed on the system).
